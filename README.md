American River College (ARC) GIS Classwork and Projects

This repository consolidates a number of legacy repos from when I was in the GIS program at American River College. 

After graduating with a BA in mathematis and statistics and dropping from a UC Davis economics program due to financial constraints, I needed to stay in academia to stay my loan repayments. Attending ARC part time supported this, and I was able to get back to subjects I was not able to study previously (Computer Science, Psychology). Once I had done that, I wanted something new, but still technical. I enjoyed geography in the past, was into fitness and land navigation with GPS; it was a natural fit to explore what GIS entailed. 

To my surprise, GIS was incredibly technical. Touching on subjects of data management, spatial data types, and even learning spatial statistics and other algorithms, I knew this was a worthwhile program to get an AS degree in. I also learned web development, web mapping, and presentation skills that still benefit me to this day--thank you Color Brewer!

The projects retained in this monorepo include my focus on using R or Python and open source tools to enable more people to make easy use of GIS. Most companies invest in ESRI ArcGIS, which is an excellent tool. As a starving student, I could not use this in my own life, if not for the outstanding resources provided by the ARC program (top notch!) and the student support by ESRI. 

So if these tools and code remain relevant or education, I am glad to have kept them around. See each project's README for further details, at least as I had described them so many years ago!

### Projects

+ GDM: A Python script tool for interfacing the Google Distance Matrix API though ArcGIS 10.1. 
+ GIS Crime Map: Web scraping, Google GIS APIs, and R mashup project.
+ Quake: GeoRSS Aggregator built for ESRI ArcGIS Feature objects.
+ OpenGIS: Final class project for data management, incorporating features from some of the above projects and beyond.
