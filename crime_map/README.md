## Crime Mapping with R and Google

During 2012-2013, I had taken on a number of open-source focused projects (dubbed "the open web") relating to my GIS degree. This one directly fueled my OpenGIS final project for advanced GIS database management. 

In this early work, I used R, an R Google mapping API, and a little web scrapping to get access to some local crime statistics and visualize them spatially.

I leave these code here as a proof-of-concept for pedogogical reasons. The resources and dependencies may no longer exist.

Let this simply encourage you to make modern efforts of your own, utilizing open-source technologies and freely available data where you can--mashups abound! That spirit drove my creativity and I hope these might inspire others.
